Introduction
Welcome to BOOGLE the Boolean Algebra Calculator and Simulator, an easy-to-use tool designed to help students and enthusiasts learn and apply the principles of Boolean algebra. This project allows users to perform basic Boolean operations and simulate their logic circuits interactively.

Features
Boolean Operations: Perform operations like AND, OR, NOT, XOR, and NAND.
Truth Table Generator: Automatically generate truth tables for custom Boolean expressions.
Logic Circuit Simulation: Visualize how Boolean expressions can be represented as logic circuits.
User-Friendly Interface: Simple and intuitive interface for all levels of users.
Installation
To set up the Boolean Algebra Calculator and Simulator on your local machine, follow these steps:

# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/ZE3Z/EECS-348-Project/main/BOOGLE.git

# Navigate to the project directory
cd BOOGLE

# Install dependencies (if any)
npm install

# Run the application
npm start

Usage
To use the calculator, enter your Boolean expression in the input field and select the operation you want to perform. The calculator will display the results instantly.

For simulation, enter the expression and click on "Simulate." The tool will show the corresponding logic circuit and the truth table.
